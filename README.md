# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Computing Architecture
## Migration to the Cloud
> > This final project for the AWS Academy Certificate in Cloud Computing Architecture details an architectural solution to move an existing application to AWS.<br><br>
> > In this scenario I am a Cloud Architect employed by GoGreen to help them move an application to AWS.<br>
> > The assignment description is as follows:
> > GoGreen is a regional insurance company based in San Diego, California. GoGreen has a three-tier CRM web application, supporting sales users at headquarters, remote users, and mobile users.<br>
> > The application supports sales personnel to input new customers' data and edit current customers' information. GoGreen's goal is to reduce the use of paper, so whenever possible, users can also upload documents such as signed contracts and pictures of assets. The application is extremely important to the business. In addition to storing customers' data and documents, it also converts these documents into multiple formats, such as images for web and mobile use. <br>
