# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Computing Architecture
## Migration to the Cloud
> > This final project for the AWS Academy Certificate in Cloud Computing Architecture details an architectural solution to move an existing application to AWS.<br><br>
> > In this scenario I am a Cloud Architect employed by GoGreen to help them move an application to AWS.<br><br>
> > The assignment description is as follows:
> > GoGreen is a regional insurance company based in San Diego, California. GoGreen has a three-tier CRM web application, supporting sales users at headquarters, remote users, and mobile users.<br>
> > The application supports sales personnel to input new customers' data and edit current customers' information. GoGreen's goal is to reduce the use of paper, so whenever possible, users can also upload documents such as signed contracts and pictures of assets. The application is extremely important to the business. In addition to storing customers' data and documents, it also converts these documents into multiple formats, such as images for web and mobile use. <br>
> > Most of the users are located on the west coast of the United States, but because some of GoGreen's customers have presence in Europe and South America, sales representatives travel to these locations and need to access the application with acceptable performance.<br>
> > Currently the application runs on premises at GoGreen's data center and consistently suffers performance and reliability issues. <br>
> > A year ago the CIO asked the IT team to ensure that the application handles increased traffic and users. As a result, the IT team overprovisioned resources, which helped alleviate the problem for the first three months. This process had to be repeated a few times.<br>
> > GoGreen's CIO, in conjunction with the CFO, concluded that purchasing new equipmnet every 2 - 4 months is not a viable solution for this environment.<br>
> > The procurement process, which is always expedited, takes about 20 days, and it costs around $100,000. <br>
